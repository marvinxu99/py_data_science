Change Jupyter Notebook startup folder (Windows)

For Window 10:
==============
(1) Right click Jupyter Notebook launcher from the menu. Select More=>Open File Location. 
It should be at C:\Users\Marvin\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Anaconda3 (64-bit)

(2) Right click on Jupyter Notebook, select Property

(3) Change the Start In field to the full path of the folder which will contain all the notebooks.
Change Start In to D:\Marvin\py_data_science.  
Also append "D:\Marvin\py_data_science" to the end of the Target field.

(4) Start the Jupyter Notebook App. The notebook interface will appear in a new browser 
window or tab. A secondary terminal window (used only for error logging and for shut down) will be also opened.

The cleanest way I found to change the default working directory is to edit the cwp.py file 
in the Anaconda folder (C:\Users\marvi\Anaconda3) as following (at the end of the file):

Replace this line:

os.chdir(documents_folder)

with the folder you want to start in:

os.chdir("C:\\Private_Files\\MachineLearning")
