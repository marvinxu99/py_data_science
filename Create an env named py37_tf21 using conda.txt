** Intall TensorFlow in Anaconda Navigator ** 

pre- steps:
(1) Run Anaconda prompt (Anaconda3)
(2) conda update -n base -c default conda

Build the venv
(1) Open Anaconda Navigator
(2) Create a new env called py37_tf21
    >conda create -n py37_tf21 python=3.7

(3) select the "tensorflow" and "tensorflow-dataset" packages from "Not Installed" (may need to update the Index to include TensorFlow)

    it will install tensorflow, tensorflow-base, and tensorflow-estimator


(3) conda activate py37_tf21
(4) pip install ipykernel

(5) python -m ipykernel install --name py37_tf21

(7) jupyter kernelspec list

(8) Enable jupyter extension:
    > conda install ipywidgets
    > conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets

(9) conda env list
    conda info
    jupyter kernelspec list

(10) Change the display name of a kernel:
 open and edit C:\ProgramData\jupyter\kernels\py37_tf21\kernel.jason

(11) change the work directory:
   see the separated .txt note

(12) If there is a HDF5 error, run the following:
   > pip uninstall h5py
   > pip install h5py

(13) Show the installed packages:
   > pip list

(14) pip install matplotlib
(15) pip instal pandas
     pip install sklearn

Change Jupyter Notebook startup folder (Windows)

For Window 10:
==============
(1) Right click Jupyter Notebook launcher from the menu. Select More=>Open File Location. 
It should be at C:\Users\Marvin\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Anaconda3 (64-bit)

(2) Right click on Jupyter Notebook, select Property

(3) Change the Start In field to the full path of the folder which will contain all the notebooks.
Change Start In to D:\Marvin\py_data_science.  
Also append "D:\Marvin\py_data_science" to the end of the Target field.

(4) Start the Jupyter Notebook App. The notebook interface will appear in a new browser 
window or tab. A secondary terminal window (used only for error logging and for shut down) will be also opened.


# The following alone is not working

The cleanest way I found to change the default working directory is to edit the cwp.py file 
in the Anaconda folder (C:\Users\marvi\Anaconda3) as following (at the end of the file):

Replace this line:

os.chdir(documents_folder)

with the folder you want to start in:

os.chdir("C:\\Private_Files\\MachineLearning")
